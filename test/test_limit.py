"""tools/limit.sh — the sitting, and the direction it may not run in.

Moved into tend with the script on 2026-08-24 (`card:cords.md`); the
tests are gestate's `test/test_limit.py`, carried whole, because the
property they hold did not change by moving: **a session may end a
sitting and may never extend one.**  That is not a promise anybody can
keep by intending to, so it is checked here — and checked *here* rather
than in gestate, because the copy that will hold the hook is this one.

Two of these are regressions gestate paid for.  The session there found
both by running the thing end to end, and `bash -n` passed on both:

* a session-closed sitting printed *"The 0 minutes are up"* instead of
  its reason, because a patch missed on indentation;
* the hook's state write dropped the reason field, so the *why* survived
  one read and vanished on the next prompt.

Nothing here touches the live sitting: `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and
`GESTATE_LIMIT_LOG` are pointed at a temporary directory.

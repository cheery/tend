"""The board's own shape, checked — `board/README.md` is the contract.

Borrowed whole from gestate's `test/test_board.py` on 2026-08-24, the
day this tree started: the one file of that project's method that is a
mechanism rather than prose, and the trials there showed mechanisms are
what travels.  Read the shape from `board/README.md` here, not there.

**The rules are executable and they live here, not in the editor.**
Henri, 2026-08-16: *"Since we're making a workbench, lets make it also a
tool that enforces our rules."*  Yes — and the enforcing belongs in the
suite, with the window as a reader of the verdict rather than its home.
The project has made that call twice already for the same reason: the
window never tokenizes, because *"a second lexer in the window would be
a second front end that could disagree with the compiler"*, and the
window never invents furniture.  A rule that lives in an editor holds
only for people using that editor — not for a collaborator with a
different one, and not for a session that writes files with tools and
never opens the workbench.

What the window would add is **timing**, not authority: saying it beside
the card while you type, the way a knob is drawn beside its own
declaration.  That wants card-editing in the workbench to be a thing
somebody does, and today `.md` opens inert.  It is a card for when that
has a caller.

The first of these is Henri's ask: *"One problem I see in the board is
that we need to check name collisions."*  A card's **filename is its
id** — cited from comments and tests the way `fixme.md`'s F-numbers are
— so two cards wearing one name is the id property quietly failing, and
the likeliest way in is a new card reusing a name that has already moved
to `done/`.
